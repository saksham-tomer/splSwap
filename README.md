# SPL Token Swap

***The basic steps involved in the process are -***

* Create a token swap pool
* Deposit liquidity
* Withdraw liquidity
* Swap tokens

*Token swap program used*

As solana does not maintain any swap program deployment , I had 2 options

1. Use my own deployment of the swap program through the souce code provided by Solana
2. Use a third party trusted deployment

##### I opted for a deployment by Serum
